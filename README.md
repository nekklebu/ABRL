# Auto Battler Roguelike (ABRL)

Welcome to **ABRL** – an experimental auto battler roguelike game built for fun, learning, and creativity. 

This project was started as a playground for designing unique character interactions, strategic auto combat, and procedural progression—all in a lightweight, flexible codebase.

**Current Status:**  
Early prototype. Core systems are under development, including basic combat mechanics, unit traits, and simple map generation.

---

## Goals

- **Auto Battler Mechanics:** Units automatically execute their actions once placed on the board.
- **Roguelike Progression:** Procedurally generated encounters, escalating difficulty, and permadeath runs.
- **Modular Design:** Keep the codebase flexible for adding new characters, abilities, and environments.
- **Satisfying Depth:** Layers of strategic decision-making without overwhelming complexity.

## Current Features

- Basic grid-based board setup
- Initial character classes with simple stats
- Turn-based auto combat flow
- Basic win/lose condition checking

## Planned Features

- Trait and synergy systems for units
- Procedural encounter generation
- Dynamic event generation between battles
- Resource management (gold, items, buffs)
- Expanded roster of characters and enemy types
- UI polish for a cleaner and more engaging experience
- Save/load system for persistent runs
